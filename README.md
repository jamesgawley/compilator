#Compilator
##Collocation of Sentences in Greek and Latin Through Machine Learning

This project uses various collocation-based algorithms (including gensim's word2vec and mallet's LDA implementations) to associate sentences in Latin and Greek.

The name 'compilator' has two meanings. In English it refers to one who collates documents on a related subject. 
In Latin it refers to one who pillages things, and as such it was an epithet for Virgil, who 'pillaged' the works of Homer et al.

Corpora are drawn from the [Tesserae corpus](http://github.com/tesserae/tesserae).

Code is written in Python. Comments include grumbling from the perspective of a long-time Perl coder.

Required packages are listed in vortex/dependencies.py.
